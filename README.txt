The Legend of Epikouros
  ~ a game made in 48h by Erhune for Ludum Dare 27
  
Copyright (c) 2013 Erhune <erhune@gmail.com>



Made in about 1 day and a half (I missed most of the first day due to IRL obligations) with the following awesome tools:


 Client made with Unity Pro 4.2, with the following publicly-but-non-free available toolkits:
   * 2D Toolkit v2.10 final + hotfix 1
   * NGUI v2.6.4
   * Images Effects (Pro Only) v3.5 (standard Unity package)

 Server made with node.js v10.x
   * npm modules: pg, coffee-script

 Graphics made with Paint.NET

 Music generated by Circuli

 SFX generated by Bfxr


This was my first Ludum Dare participation, and all together I managed to implement a big part of the concept I thought of. I just hope my server won't crash too fast, and that players won't find world-breaking bugs (that's the issue with the concept: only one bug can ruin the experience for everyone ^^').

Anyway, have fun with this source code, and DON'T SPOIL YOURSELF THE GAME by analysing the levels, please!
